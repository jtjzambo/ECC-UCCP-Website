  uccpHistory: {
    title: "The United Church of Christ in the Philippines",
    subtitle: "A Historic Union for Filipino Christianity",
    
    introduction: "The UCCP represents one of the most significant achievements of Christian unity in Asia—a historic union that brought together diverse Protestant traditions into a single, unified church committed to serving the Filipino people.",
    
    foundingStory: {
      title: "The Founding Story (1898-1948)",
      content: "The roots of the UCCP trace back to the arrival of Protestant missionaries following the Philippine Revolution of 1898. When the Philippines transitioned from Spanish to American sovereignty, Methodist chaplain George C. Stull conducted the first Protestant worship service in the country. This marked the beginning of an extraordinary journey.\n\nStarting in 1899, various American mission boards—Methodist Episcopal Church, Presbyterian Church, Church of the United Brethren, Foreign Christian Missionary Society, and Congregational Church—sent missionaries to the Philippines. These pioneers established not only churches but also vital institutions: Silliman Institute (1901, later Silliman University), Union Theological Seminary (1907), and numerous hospitals.\n\nRecognizing the need for unity rather than competition, these mission groups formed the Evangelical Union in 1902 to foster cooperation and work toward a national church. This vision progressed through several stages: the United Church of Manila (1924), the United Evangelical Church (1929), and the Philippine Methodist Church (1933).\n\nDuring World War II, under Japanese occupation, Filipino church leaders demonstrated remarkable courage by forming the Evangelical Church of the Philippines in 1943—the first union under Filipino leadership. This wartime experience strengthened the resolve for complete union.\n\nOn May 22-25, 1948, at the historic Uniting Assembly in Ellinwood Malate Church, Manila, 165 delegates from three churches signed the declaration of union, formally establishing the United Church of Christ in the Philippines. The first bishops elected were Rev. Enrique Sobrepeña (North Luzon), Rev. Cipriano Navarro (South Luzon), Rev. Leonardo G. Dia (Visayas), and Rev. Proculo Rodriguez (Mindanao)."
